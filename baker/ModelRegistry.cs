Author the clip so frame 0 = travelling (undeployed) and deployPoseTime = deployed. Per-unit, instant snap, no state machine. Combine with fireOnAttack for deploy+recoil on one clip: author deploy in [0, deployPoseTime] and the recoil kickback in [deployPoseTime, 1] (deploy_convert.py recoilSrcStart/End); the fire event then sweeps the tail once.

The plugin drops every AudioEmitter.PostEvent on our opted-in pawns (the one chokepoint both sounds use) and StopAll's the idle loop once.
