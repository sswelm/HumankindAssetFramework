# rig_anim.py — prepare a RIGGED, ANIMATED model for the Universal Model Factory's animated path.
# Unlike mesh_reduce.py (which only decimates geometry), this KEEPS the model's armature + one animation clip so the
# Factory can bake an Amplitude Skeleton + ClipCollection from it. Steps:
#   1. import (glb/gltf/fbx/blend) and drop material-less junk meshes (stray icospheres etc.)
#   2. pick one action, assign it, delete the rest
#   3. OPTIONAL bone filter: keep animation only on bones whose name starts with one of the given prefixes
#      (e.g. "prop,rotor") — strips camera/body-bob curves that make a model wobble; empty = keep the whole clip
#   4. clamp the SCENE frame range to the action's real range — bake_anim otherwise pads frozen tail frames (default
#      1..250) that make the animation stall for ~1s each loop
#   5. export the first material's base-colour image as the albedo PNG (for the Factory's atlas)
#   6. join to 1 mesh + 1 material + quadric-decimate to ~target tris (KEEPING the armature + weights)
#   7. export a slim FBX with baked animation

# chain to find the governing bone (a child hung off a bone-parented mesh follows that same bone). BIND AT REST so the
