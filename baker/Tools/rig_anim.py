# rig_anim.py — prepare a RIGGED, ANIMATED model for the Universal Model Factory's animated path.
# Unlike mesh_reduce.py (which only decimates geometry), this KEEPS the model's armature + one animation clip so the
# Factory can bake an Amplitude Skeleton + ClipCollection from it. Steps:
#   1. import (glb/gltf/fbx/blend) and drop material-less junk meshes (stray icospheres etc.)
#   2. pick one action, assign it, delete the rest
#   3. OPTIONAL bone filter: keep animation only on bones whose name starts with one of the given prefixes
#      (e.g. "prop,rotor") — strips camera/body-bob curves that make a model wobble; empty = keep the whole clip
#   4. clamp the SCENE frame range to the action's real range — bake_anim otherwise pads frozen tail frames (default
#      1..250) that make the animation stall for ~1s each loop
#   5. export the first material's base-colour image as the albedo PNG (for the Factory's atlas)
#   6. join to 1 mesh + 1 material + quadric-decimate to ~target tris (KEEPING the armature + weights)
#   7. export a slim FBX with baked animation
# Usage: blender -b --python rig_anim.py -- <input> <output.fbx> <targetTris> [bonePrefixesCSV] [clipName] [albedoOut.png] [keepMats] [rotXdeg,rotYdeg,rotZdeg]

# it caves smooth cylinders (a cannon's barrels) into slivers while spoked parts survive. Merging by

# skinned mesh keeps its vertices in mesh/bind space, and both the Factory preview (raw mesh) and Amplitude's
# skeleton bake (SetPrefab/ImportMeshes) read the DATA, discarding object transforms — an object-only rotation
# looked applied in the log yet changed nothing in-game. Registry mapping: x -> Blender world X (pitch — stands a
# lying-on-its-back rig upright), y -> Blender world Z (heading), z -> Blender world Y (roll). Applying the SAME
# world rotation to armature rest bones AND mesh vertices keeps the skin binding aligned; bone-local animation
# curves are relative to the (now-rotated) rest pose, so the clip plays identically.
# RIG ROTATION — ONLY when a rotation is requested (rotation 0,0,0 = the EXACT legacy pipeline, byte-for-byte: no
# object fiddling, no fold — models that were correct before stay correct; the fold is world-preserving for Unity's
# mesh import but NOT for Amplitude's skeleton bake, so folding unconditionally flipped the previously-good howitzer
# upside-down in-game). When a rotation IS set: rotate the parent-less objects in world space, strip OBJECT-level
# animation fcurves (a glTF often keys the armature NODE itself — they block transform_apply and re-assert the old
# orientation each frame), then transform_apply INTO THE DATA (vertices + bone rests, identity nodes) — object-level
# rotation alone is dropped downstream (proven in-game on the Combine soldier, which needs 90,0,0 to stand).
