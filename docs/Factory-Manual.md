# Universal Model Factory — User Manual

How to put your own 3D model onto a Humankind unit, step by step. This is the practical guide.

The Factory is a Unity editor window (**Tools ▸ Universal Model Factory**). You give it a model file and a target unit, set
a few options, press **Bake**, then rebuild the mod. The in-game plugin reads what you baked and renders it.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **The modding Unity project** open (the one with the Humankind SDK + the Factory editor scripts under
  `Assets/Scripts/Editor/`).
- **A model file**: `.glb`, `.gltf`, `.obj`, `.fbx`, or `.blend`. It must be **UV-mapped + textured** if you want a skin.
- **Blender** — required only for: **animated** models, **`.blend`** import, and **Reduce-to-tris** decimation. Static
  GLB/OBJ/FBX bakes need no Blender. It's auto-detected under `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation`; if it's elsewhere,
  set the path in the Factory's **Settings** panel.
- **The game installed** (Steam auto-detected). The registry the plugin reads is written into `<Humankind>\BepInEx\config`.

## 2. Quick start (static model)

1. **Tools ▸ Universal Model Factory**.
2. **Pawn description → Pick** — choose the unit your model replaces (e.g. `Era6_Common_Hovercrafts_01`). A **Resource
   name** is suggested; keep or edit it.
3. **Model file → Browse** — pick your `.glb`/`.obj`/`.fbx`.
4. Set **Size** (world length of the longest axis) and, if needed, **Rotation** / **Position**.
5. **Bake.** Watch the Console for `[Factory] <name> DONE. skeleton=… atlas=…`.
6. **Rebuild the mod** (see §6) and relaunch.

That's the whole loop. Everything below is detail and the animated workflow.

## 3. The window, field by field

### Settings — game & Blender path (foldout at the top)
- **Game path** — auto-detected `<Humankind>\BepInEx\config` (where the registry is written). Override if detection
  misses your install. A `⚠` on the header means it wasn't found.
- **Blender** — the detected `blender.exe`, or `⚠ not detected`. Set the **Override** (or `EditorPrefs 'ENC.blenderPath'`)
  if Blender is elsewhere or only on `PATH`. Only matters for animated / `.blend` / Reduce-to-tris.

### 3D resource
- Dropdown of existing baked models (or `<New>`). Picking one **loads its settings** so you can re-bake with tweaks.
- **Refresh** re-reads the registry. **Remove** drops the selected entry from the registry (the baked assets stay in the
  project; the plugin just stops injecting it).

### Resource name / Pawn description / Model file
- **Resource name** — unique id; names all the baked assets (`<name>_Skeleton`, `<name>_Atlas`, …).
- **Pawn description** — the target unit. **Pick** opens a searchable list of every `PresentationPawnDefinition`.
- **Model file** — `.glb/.gltf/.obj/.fbx/.blend`. **Leave empty when re-baking** an existing resource to reuse the
  already-imported model with new settings (fast iteration).

### Animation
- **Animated (own rig + clip)** — bake the model's **own armature + animation** so it moves in-game (e.g. a drone's props
  spin). The toggle is **greyed out for models with no animation** (a cheap probe checks without Blender). See §5.
- **Clip name** *(Pick)* — which clip to bake when the model has several (a Sketchfab model often ships `hover`,
  `exploded_view`, …). **Pick** lists the clips read from the model. Empty = the model's first/assigned clip.
- **Animate only bones** *(Pick)* — comma-separated bone-name **prefixes** to keep animation on (e.g. `prop`). Strips
  everything else (camera pans, body bob) that would make the model wobble. **Pick** lists the bone prefixes with counts.
  Empty = keep the whole clip.

### Transform
- **Rotation offset (XYZ)** — degrees, on top of the auto forward-alignment. Static models bake this into the mesh; for
  animated models the orientation comes from the model's own rig, so export it facing correctly.
- **Position offset (x, y, z = height)** — Static models bake it in (z = waterline; negative sinks a ship). For
  **animated** models it's applied as a **runtime world offset** — **z raises altitude** — so you can change it and just
  **relaunch, no re-bake**. This decouples altitude from Size (keep a small drone but fly it high).
- **Size (units)** — the world length of the model's longest axis. This is what you tune to make the model the right
  size next to other units. The Factory computes the scale for you; the Console logs it.

### Mesh / shading *(ignored in Animated mode)*
- **Normals** — `KeepModel` (artist's normals) / `Recalculate` (hard edges via the **Smoothing angle** slider) /
  `Faceted` (fully flat).
- **Height-based UVs** — override UVs with V = normalized height, so a vertical-gradient albedo maps by height (black
  skirt low, grey hull high). For untextured CAD models that just need a simple gradient skin.
- **Winding fix (CAD/convex)** — rewind faces outward so single-sided / CAD "sketch" meshes render instead of culling to
  invisible. Lightest fix; assumes a roughly convex hull (vehicles/ships).
- **Double-sided (single-sided/CAD)** — add a back face to every surface (heavier fallback for genuinely non-convex thin
  shells). Doubles the triangle count — and **halves the effective Reduce-to-tris** automatically.
- **Reduce to ~tris (0 = off)** — quadric-decimate a heavy model to about this many triangles (via Blender) to fit the
  engine's shared mesh buffer (~25k per model is the practical ceiling). It's a **ceiling, not a quota**: a model already
  under it passes through untouched. No Blender? Use **Convert grid** instead (below).
- **Strip parts (names)** *(Pick)* — comma-separated object-name substrings to **DELETE from *your* model** before baking
  (each match takes its children too). The **mirror of Hide-donor**, but on your source mesh: use it to drop a part you
  don't want baked in — most importantly a **helicopter's own rotor(s)**, so the **donor's animated rotor spins through** in
  its place (also crew figures, weapon pods…). The donor helicopter animates *two* rotor bones (`Helix` main + `Helix_back`
  tail), so stripping **both** your main and tail rotor gets you a spinning main rotor *and* a spinning shrouded fantail.
  **Pick** reads the object names straight from the model file (GLB/glTF; for FBX/OBJ/.blend, type them by hand — open in
  Blender to see names). Case-insensitive substring match; needs Blender (it runs a delete-and-export step). Proven on the
  RAH-66 Comanche (`Cylinder06,Cylinder07` removed its main-rotor blades).
- **Hide donor meshes** *(Pick)* — comma-separated name substrings of the **donor unit's extra parts** to hide (e.g. a
  leftover rotor). **Pick** reads the donor fragment names the plugin logged to `BepInEx\LogOutput.log` — so **launch the
  game once** with the model injected, then Pick. Runtime-only (takes effect on reload, no re-bake). *Can't* hide a
  donor's animated sub-parts (a rotor, spinning wheels) — those are baked at pawn spawn; pick a cleaner donor instead.
- **Re-spawn after load (borrowed rotor fix)** — fixes a spawn quirk: the engine draws the **first** borrowed-rotor pawn of
  a model, *when it's created*, with its rotor ~1 unit low (every other instance is fine). Tick this and the plugin watches
  for any such unit appearing — on a save-load, built in a city, or dev-spawned — and near-instantly re-runs the game's own
  pawn rebuild on it, so the rotor comes out right every time (a brief one-time flicker as it rebuilds, no unit affected).
  **Tick ONLY** for models that borrow a donor's animated sub-part (a spinning rotor, i.e. you used **Strip parts** to drop
  your own rotor); pointless flicker on any other model. Runtime-only (no re-bake needed — it's a registry flag). The delay
  before the re-spawn is tunable in the plugin cfg (`Factory/RespawnDelayFrames`, default 1 frame) if a slow machine shows
  the low rotor briefly before it corrects.
- **Convert grid** — GLB/glTF only. `0` = faithful (keeps UV seams — use for textured models). `>0` = vertex-cluster
  decimation **without Blender** (coarser; averages UVs across seams, so only for heavy *untextured* meshes).

### Texture / import
- **Reuse extracted files** — skip re-importing/re-slimming and reuse what's already in the resource folder. Tick it to
  keep a **hand-edited texture** across a re-bake, or to iterate on **Size/transform** fast. **Untick it** if you changed
  the Model file, the Clip, or the Animate-only-bones — otherwise the slim step is skipped and your change is ignored.

### Bake / Reset
- **Bake** runs the pipeline and writes the registry. **Reset** clears the form.

### Preview panel
An interactive 3D preview is embedded near the bottom of the window (drag to orbit, scroll to zoom). It **auto-updates
after every Bake** and when you pick a resource from the **3D resource** dropdown — so you see the baked result *in the
window*, no hunting in the Project view. It renders the baked prefab: `<name>_Preview.prefab` for **animated** models (a
static, textured, upright copy of the injected mesh — not itself injected) or `<name>_Model.prefab` for **static** models.
Use it to judge geometry, skin, and — with the **Reduce to ~tris** field + the Console vert/tri count — to dial in the
lowest triangle count with no visible loss: drop the count → Bake → watch the model degrade live, then step back up.

## 4. Static model workflow

1. Pawn description (Pick) + Resource name.
2. Model file (Browse).
3. **Textured model?** leave **Convert grid = 0** (preserves UV seams). Untextured CAD model? consider **Height-based
   UVs** or a **Convert grid > 0**.
4. **Renders invisible / see-through in-game?** it's a single-sided/CAD mesh — enable **Winding fix**, or **Double-sided**
   for non-convex shells.
5. **Heavy model?** set **Reduce to ~tris** (default 24000). Overflowing the shared buffer drops geometry silently.
6. Set **Size** / **Rotation** / **Position**. **Bake** → rebuild mod → relaunch. Tweak and re-bake (Model file empty) as
   needed.

---

## 5. Animated model workflow

Your model must be **rigged with a skeletal animation** (an armature + at least one clip). glTF/GLB is easiest (the clip
and bone pickers read it directly).

1. **Pawn description** — choose a donor with **no animated sub-parts** and a full idle/move set (a land vehicle is ideal;
   an attack-helicopter donor forces its rotor onto your model). Resource name.
2. **Model file** — the rigged `.glb`/`.fbx`. If detection finds animation, the **Animated** toggle enables and you'll see
   *"Animation detected"*.
3. Tick **Animated**.
4. **Clip name → Pick →** choose the loop you want (e.g. `hover`). Not the exploded/assembly clips.
5. **Animate only bones → Pick →** choose the spinning group (e.g. `prop`). This keeps only those bones animated and
   freezes the rest, killing camera/body wobble. Leave empty for a fully-animated model (a walker, a turret).
6. **Size** — the drone is small; try `4`. The Console logs the computed Scale Factor.
7. Make sure **Blender is detected** (Settings). **Bake.** Watch for:
   ```
   [Factory] <name> FBX scale factor … (native longest … -> <Size> units)
   [Factory] <name> ANIMATED DONE. skeleton=… clip=… atlas=…
   ```
   A **non-zero `clip=`** means the animation baked correctly.
8. **Rebuild the mod** (§6) and relaunch. The model should render and play its clip at real speed.

**Iterating on an animated model:** changing **Size/transform** only? leave **Reuse extracted** ticked (it skips the slow
re-slim). Changing the **Clip**, **Animate-only-bones**, or the **Model file**? **untick Reuse extracted** so it re-slims.

---

## 6. After baking: rebuild the mod (don't skip this)

Baking writes assets into the Unity project + the registry, but the game loads your mod's **built AssetBundle**. Your baked
skeleton / clip / atlas **won't reach the game until you rebuild/export the mod** (your normal Humankind mod build step).
Then relaunch. This is the #1 "why didn't my change show up" cause.

---

## 7. Presentation tips — make the unit read well

A few *game-data* touches (in `Databases`, not the Factory) that make an injected model land better on the battlefield.
These are `PresentationUnitDefinition` / `UnitDefinition` edits — independent of the model bake, and they need a **mod
rebuild**.

**Formation = a swarm (visibility + presence).** The unit's `PresentationUnitDefinition` → **Presentation Formation
Definition** controls how many *dummy figures* are drawn for the one unit. Switch a recon drone to `Formation_Wedge_3` and
it renders as **three drones in a wedge** — far more visible on the map, and it reads as *less fragile* (a coordinated
swarm vs a lone scout). It composes for free with an injected **animated** model: every formation dummy is the same pawn
descriptor, so the plugin's multi-instance handling gives each one our skeleton + clip — all of them render and spin.
Tune spacing with **Dummy Offset Position / Angle**.

**Purely visual — not stronger.** Formation dummies are cosmetic; they add zero HP or damage. It's still one unit (one
health bar, one combat roll; the figures move / fight / die together). If you want it to *be* as sturdy as it looks, edit
the gameplay stats in its **`LandUnitDefinition`** (combat strength / health / defense) — a separate `Databases` edit.

**Altitude (animated only).** The registry `position.z` raises an animated model at runtime (§5) — set it high enough
that the swarm clears tall city buildings and stays above the terrain. Combined, formation + altitude make the unit read
clearly at **every zoom**: close-up spinning props, mid-range city-skyline flyover, and an identifiable banner on the
strategic map.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| **Model invisible / see-through** | Single-sided/CAD mesh (backface-culled) → **Winding fix** or **Double-sided**. Or it overflowed the shared buffer → lower **Reduce to ~tris**. |
| **Model tiny (a speck) or huge** | **Size** is the world length — set it to what looks right; the Console logs the scale. |
| **Change didn't show in-game** | You didn't **rebuild the mod** (§6). Or **Reuse extracted** was on and skipped the re-slim after you changed Clip/bones/model — untick it. |
| **Animated toggle greyed out** | The model has no animation the probe can see (OBJ, or a glTF with no `animations`). Use a rigged glb/fbx. FBX/.blend can't be probed cheaply, so the toggle stays enabled — type the clip/bones by hand. |
| **"No clips readable from this model"** | Clip/Bone Pick works for glTF/GLB only. For FBX/.blend, type the clip name and bone prefixes manually. |
| **Animated model plays the wrong motion** (parts assemble/explode) | You baked the wrong clip → set **Clip name** to the loop (e.g. `hover`), not `exploded_view`. |
| **Animated model tears apart / arms fly out** | The clip source wasn't isolated (an extra FBX in the folder → a multi-clip collection). Fixed in the current Factory (it bakes into a per-model `anim/` subfolder). Re-bake; if it persists, remove stray `.fbx` from the resource folder. |
| **~1s stall each loop** | A padded frozen tail in the clip. The Factory auto-clamps the frame range now — re-bake. |
| **Body wobbles / "unbalanced flywheel"** | The clip animates the whole body → set **Animate only bones** to just the spinning group (e.g. `prop`). |
| **A donor part shows through** (rotor, extra mesh) | **Hide donor meshes → Pick** it (after one launch so it's logged). If it's an *animated* donor sub-part, it can't be hidden — pick a cleaner donor. |
| **First unit's borrowed rotor sits ~1 low** (after a load, or on a freshly built/spawned unit; other instances fine) | An engine spawn race on the first pawn of the model, at creation. Tick **Re-spawn after load** on that model — the plugin rebuilds the unit's pawns right after it renders and the rotor comes out right (tune `Factory/RespawnDelayFrames` in the plugin cfg if it's briefly visible). Registry flag, no re-bake. |
| **Bake fails: "needs Blender"** | Install Blender or set its path in **Settings**. For static decimation without Blender, use **Convert grid** instead of Reduce-to-tris. |
| **Re-baked static model is 90° off / tipped up in-game** (preview looks fine) | An older Factory shipped a **stale skeleton** on re-bake (the static outputs were overwritten in place, so the skeleton baked from cached geometry). Fixed now — the static path deletes its outputs and force-reimports before baking the skeleton, so a re-bake matches a first bake. Just **re-bake → rebuild → relaunch**. |
| **Texture looks stale in the editor** | A Unity texture-residency quirk after a multi-material bake — open the source textures in the Project view and back. The in-game result is correct. |
| **Multi-material GLB comes out untextured / grey** | Fixed — `glbconv` now emits `usemtl` groups + a `.mtl` (and solid-colour swatches for flat parts), so a multi-material GLB atlases like FBX. **Re-bake** an older GLB model to pick this up (it was baked before the converter preserved materials). Keep **Convert grid = 0** (faithful mode; material grouping only runs there). |
| **A part is missing in-game but present in the Factory preview** (a mast, antenna — typically small parts, no error anywhere) | **Shared vertex-buffer overflow.** All injected models + the game's own fx meshes share one ~100k-vertex GPU buffer; overflow is **silently truncated from the tail of the last-registered model's mesh** — so late-order parts of your newest model vanish while its body renders fine. The preview is immune (it renders the mesh asset directly). Diagnosed live: a 48k-vert bake lost its rotor mast; visible again after **Reduce to ~tris** brought it down. Watch the bake log's `verts=` line — stay well under ~25k verts per model (UV-seam splitting means verts ≈ 2× tris on textured models, so a 12000-tri target ≈ 24k verts). |
| **Re-bake has no effect in-game** (still the old shape/orientation; preview shows the new one) | You re-baked but didn't **rebuild the mod**. A re-bake keeps the **same skeleton GUID**, so the registry doesn't change and the game silently keeps rendering the old geometry from the previously built bundle — no error, nothing to see in the log. Every geometry change needs bake → **rebuild mod** → relaunch. (Quick sanity test: bake with a wild rotation offset — if the game doesn't tilt, your build isn't reaching it.) |
| **Source folder created with the wrong case** (e.g. `attackHelicopter/` not `AttackHelicopter/`) | Cosmetic, bake-time only. Windows/Unity is case-insensitive + case-preserving, so the folder inherits the spelling of any pre-existing differently-cased asset of that name (e.g. a vanilla `attackHelicopter512.png`). Baked assets, registry, and in-game loading are all correctly cased. Use a non-colliding `resourceName` (e.g. `AH1Cobra`) if you want the folder capitalised. |

## 9. Where things land

- **Baked assets:** `Assets/Resources/<name>_Skeleton.asset`, `_Atlas.asset`, `_Mat.mat`, `_ModelMesh.asset`
  (static); animated adds `_Clips.asset` and a `<name>/anim/<name>_anim.fbx`. The imported model + albedo sit in
  `Assets/Resources/<name>/`.
- **Registry:** `<Humankind>\BepInEx\config\enc_models.json` — one entry per model (pawn description, `skel`/`atlas` GUIDs,
  transform, flags; animated adds `clip` + `animated`/`animClip`/`animateBones`).
- **Runtime log:** `<Humankind>\BepInEx\LogOutput.log` — `[Uni] …` lines show what was injected (and the donor fragment
  names the Hide-donor Pick reads).
