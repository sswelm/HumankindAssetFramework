# Framework Review — Model Factory

Living hardening roadmap. Four review passes so far, most recent first:

1. **2026-07-12 — architectural / structural review** (see "Architectural findings" below): stepped back from
   line-bugs to *system structure*, given the stated direction (many more models; eventual distributable
   package). Surfaced the per-pawn god-method (**A1, now fixed**), the four-place registry-schema duplication
   (A3), and the `ModelEntry` god-object (A2), plus two suspected baker bugs (A4) and the package-readiness gap (A5).
2. **2026-07-07 — full critical re-review**: the runtime plugin read line-by-line,
   the editor pipeline and all tools swept by independent reviewers, and the two headline Blender findings
   **empirically verified on Blender 5.1.2** (the same install the pipeline auto-detects).
3. **2026-07-07 — external review** (received by mail): five findings + three comment-drift items, all
   verified against the code and fixed same day (see "Fixed to date").
4. **2026-07-05 — self-review**: registry safety, process timeouts, dead code. Fixed or consciously deferred.

**Overall verdict (unchanged and reinforced):** disciplined code for what it is — a reflection-heavy
BepInEx mod poking at a closed engine. Verified strengths: per-hook and per-model failure isolation,
fail-loud resolution of required SDK methods, empty-GUID validation, atomic registry writes with a
versioned git-tracked backup, bounded shell-outs with dual-stream draining, one-shot error logging on hot
paths, correct boxed-struct mutate/write-back in the pose hook. The gaps below are mostly *silent-failure
edges* and *surviving-a-stranger's-machine* items, not broken-today bugs — everything the author uses
daily works.

Severity key: 🔴 fix soon (silent data loss / silent no-inject) · 🟡 worth hardening · 🟢 cleanup.

## Fixed to date (condensed history)

| Date | Fix |
|---|---|
| 07-05 | Registry atomic write (`.tmp` + `File.Replace`), corrupt-file guard (`.corrupt.json`, Save refuses), versioned project backup + auto-restore |
| 07-05 | `RunBounded` 3-min cap on all five shell-outs (but see **E4** below — one unbounded path remains) |
| 07-05 | `[SerializeField]` form persistence; dead `LoadHookPatch` removed; F8 window un-broken |
| 07-06 | Resource-name whitespace/char guard (window gate + baker `Fail`), quoted glbconv arg |
| 07-06 | Multi-material GLB: glbconv emits `usemtl`/`.mtl`/solid swatches; baker matches `.jpg` albedos |
| 07-07 | *(external #1)* `LoadRegistry` no longer latches `loaded=true` before the read — retries transient failures up to 3× |
| 07-07 | *(external #2)* regex fallback parses `respawnAfterLoad` (parity with Newtonsoft path) |
| 07-07 | *(external #3)* `ModelRegistry.Save` atomic swap guarded; `Save`/`Upsert`/`Remove` return bool; `DoBake` reports "Baked, but REGISTRY SAVE FAILED" instead of a false ✓ |
| 07-07 | *(external #5)* `Prober.TestWrite` labelled: leaves an inert placeholder in the live registry until restart |
| 07-07 | Comment drift: `enc_models.txt`→`.json`; ModelRegistry header no longer claims JsonUtility works at game runtime (it silently returns empty there — the plugin **must** keep Newtonsoft); `ReadDonorFragments` header matches its whole-log-scan body |
| 07-07 | *(this review)* `EnsureRegistered` latched `registered=true` on empty entries, permanently defeating the new load-retry (retry would succeed, registration never ran again → injection silently dead for the session). Now latches only when the load actually succeeded. |
| 07-07 | csproj: `DefaultItemExcludes baker\**` — glbconv's .NET 8 publish output was being swept in as candidate assemblies, making the net471 build fail with 271 phantom type errors |
| 07-12 | **A1**: `OnPawnAdded` decomposed from a ~190-line per-pawn-per-frame god-method into a dispatcher + one named handler per behavior (verified in-game + 12/12 bake smoke test) |
| 07-12 | Registry kept **alphabetical** on load AND save (`ModelRegistry.SortByName`) — a stable Factory dropdown and no more meaningless reorder churn in the git-tracked backup on every bake |
| 07-12 | **A3**: `check_schema_parity.sh` rewritten — Newtonsoft==regex read paths, read⊆written, and read-cast==declared-type; verified to fail on each drift type (Option A: verify, don't merge) |
| 07-12 | **T3/T4** (`rig_anim.py`): albedo grab traces the Principled Base Color (not the first image node); join re-binds the armature modifier so a bone-parented-prop-first model can't export rigid. **T5** (glbconv mirrored-node winding): source + **exe rebuilt** (SharpGLTF pinned 1.0.6, verified geometry-identical across all 11 registry models); build now documented in `Tools/glbconv/BUILD.md` |
| 07-12 | **E5**: `Build`/`BuildAnimated` snapshot the baked outputs (asset + .meta) before a re-bake and restore them on any failure — a partway-failed re-bake no longer destroys the last-good model. Fail-safe (restore runs only on failure); 12/12 smoke test |
| 07-12 | **E2/E3/E4** editor hardening: Remove keys on the selected entry + honest status; static bake fails loud on 0 vertices (no silent invisible unit); `RunBounded` bounds the pipe drain so a grandchild-held pipe can't hang the editor. 12/12 smoke test |
| 07-12 | **Bake Feature Test** (`Tools ▸ ENC ▸ Bake Feature Test`): new integration test proving each baker *feature knob* does what it claims — bakes a self-contained synthetic cube per-knob and asserts a feature-specific invariant (doubleSided 2× tris, Faceted unweld, atlasMaxDim cap, heightUV, size/position, brightness/saturation, …). Non-destructive; **Tier 1** 12/12 |
| 07-12 | **Bake Feature Test — Tier 2** (`… Tier 2 — Blender + animated`): `targetTris` decimates a generated high-poly grid (5000→600), `stripParts` drops a generated named object (24→12 tris), and the animated pipeline (`BuildAnimated` → skeleton + clip) is exercised by borrowing ReconDrone + TowedGunHowitzers from the registry. **4/4** |
| 07-12 | **A4**: `BuildMultiAtlasAndRemap` submesh→rect match now tries EXACT before the loose substring — an animated multi-material model with prefix-colliding material names (`Body`/`Body_Trim`) no longer maps the wrong texture. (`MeasureLongestAxis` half verified-and-dismissed: `rig_anim` joins to one mesh, so the per-node transform is moot.) |
| 07-12 | **E6/E8** (🟢): backup restore parses in its own try/catch (a corrupt backup + missing registry no longer locks Save with a misleading error); both multi-material `PackTextures` sites free their source albedos so a bake no longer strands tens of MB until domain reload |
| 07-13 | **E7** (🟢): the static re-bake's delete-first now clears the stale animated `_Preview.prefab`/`_PreviewMesh`/`_PreviewMat` from FactorySource, so the window preview shows the fresh static model instead of the old animated one |
| 07-13 | **T6** (🟢): `rig_anim.py` hard-fails when a bone-prefix filter matches nothing (frozen-clip trap; lists the real bones); `prep_model.py` hard-fails when a strip/reduce leaves no mesh (empty-GLB trap). Both syntax-checked. **T7** lows reviewed + consciously deferred (each needs a glbconv rebuild or changes output for ~zero benefit) |
| 07-13 | **2nd critical review** (independent adversarial pass, 3 reviewers): confirmed the `OnPawnAdded` refactor faithful and E5's core sound. Fixed a `heightUV` feature-test **false-green** (now asserts V *tracks vertex height*, not merely spans [0,1]); added an **E5-rollback test** that forces a failed re-bake and proves the assets restore with original GUIDs + content. Feature Test Tier 1 now **13/13**. |
| 07-14 | **HAF multi-mod (phase 1)**: `LoadRegistry` is now a multi-**pack** loader — discovers ENC's base `enc_models.json` + any `haf_packs/*.json`, merges by `pawnDescription` (first-loaded wins on an undeclared clash, logged loud — no silent overrides), and writes `haf_load_report.txt`. The old Newtonsoft-primary + regex-fallback parse was lifted **verbatim** into `ParseModels` (transient-retry/3×-latch preserved). Baker writes a `RegistryFile` wrapper (`schemaVersion`/`modId`/`dependsOn`/`loadAfter`/`overrides`); `check_schema_parity.sh` gained wrapper-key parity (and its ModelDef-body terminator was fixed for the class rename). `dependsOn`/`loadAfter`/`overrides`/`patches` are **reserved-and-logged**, not yet enforced. Verified in-game (13 models, 1 pack, 0 conflicts). Spec: [Multi-Mod.md](Multi-Mod.md). |
| 07-16 | **Vertex budget: per-mesh cap mapped, all limits overridable**: `ContentLayer.maxMeshTriangleCount` is a per-mesh triangle cap that **silently truncates** excess quads at encode (holes, no log) — but ships **0 = unlimited on every layer**, so there is no hard per-unit cap; the practical limit is the pawn layer's shared pool (1M verts, ~70% baseline). Measured: a FRESH game reads the same fill as a Contemporary save → the pool is filled **roster-wide at load**, not per-era (kills the era-clustering theory; both Vertex-Budget open questions answered). New generic `[Buffers] BufferOverrides = <layer>:verts=+N,idx=+N,meshes=+N,maxtris=N` (same creation seam as DistrictBufferHeadroom, any layer); budget readout is now an F8-window **"Mesh Budget" button** incl. maxTris/mesh. Docs: [Vertex-Budget.md](Vertex-Budget.md) rewritten. |
| 07-16 | **Pawn PROP axis — SOLVED (third injection axis)**: custom weapons/gear on pawn attachment slots — Slingers now carry an actual sling. Rides the game's own data path (pawn def `Attachements[] → PresentationPawnFragmentMesh {ModelPrefab, ModelName, MaterialRef}` = rigid mesh glued to the slot's bone); the one gate is the fragment's MeshCollection needing registration with the AnimationManager. Editor: **Tools ▸ ENC ▸ Prop Lab** (`PropBaker.cs`) — dump any vanilla fragment by GUID (accepts the Asset Picker's 32-hex form; nibble-swap encoding) as the authoring template, then one Bake = static bake (no dummy pawn) → bone-free FxMesh (`mergeSubMeshes`: the fragment GPU encoder draws only submesh 0) → MeshCollection + fragment assets. Runtime: `Hk_PropRegister` postfix on `AnimationManager.AnimationLoad` registers our collections via the public `RegisterMeshCollection` before pawn resolution (an Update-tick loses that race → the pawn def fails Load and units render as pawn definition 0 — a herd of mammoths); Amplitude's catalog misses mod MeshCollections by GUID → by-name fallback from the mounted Unity bundles. Full recipe + traps: [Pawn-Props.md](Pawn-Props.md). |
| 07-16 | **District pipeline productized (dialog + registry)**: districts got their own Factory. Editor: **Tools ▸ ENC ▸ District Factory** (`DistrictFactoryWindow`) — pick a district (searchable dropdown over the project's district definitions), Browse a model, set Size/Rotation/import-angles/Target-tris/Isolate, one **Bake** runs the static bake core (**no dummy pawn** — `pawnDescription` was registry-only in `UniversalBaker.Build`), wraps a bone-free FxMesh (`DistrictBaker.BakeFxMesh`, now callable), and writes the entry; `DistrictRegistry` mirrors `ModelRegistry` (corrupt-guard, atomic write, git-tracked backup). Runtime: `enc_districts.json` registry — **any number of districts at once**, per-entry `{district, fxMeshGuid, isolate}` with private-leaf machinery per entry (`DistrictModel`/`distModels`); legacy `[District]` single-model keys remain as fallback when the registry is empty; F8 "Dump District" is entries-aware. Reactor migrated (dummy `Era0_Common_Bears_01` unit entries removed). **Verified in-game end-to-end.** |
| 07-16 | **District model injection — SOLVED (custom mesh on ONE tile)**: the axis works end-to-end. Recipe: give the district a renderable `ConstructibleVisualAffinity` + **clear its Additional Visual Levels** (the `DistrictState` criterion, not the district class, was why swaps resolved to null); at runtime walk `Selector(culture) → pairs → Emitter.levelBuildItems[].loadedEvolverMaterial → FxEvolverMaterialLevelBuildElement`, set each leaf's `fxMesh` to our baked FxMesh and call the leaf's `Load()` to re-resolve `meshIndex` (reusing the game's own leaf keeps the selector GPU context — a foreign `SetChannel` material drew nothing). The mesh must be **bone-free** (static shader can't read skinned verts) and **lean** (the shared 'Visual' GPU buffer, 3,000,000 verts, runs ~99.85% full late-game; oversize meshes get a slot but silently overflow). `DistrictBufferHeadroom` (opt-in) enlarges that buffer (3M→5M verified). `DistrictIsolate` **scopes to one tile**: build a private `Instantiate`d leaf, point only that district's own channel + Shuriken particle at it via `RefreshChannel`. All off by default. Full recipe: [District-Visuals.md](District-Visuals.md). |
| 07-15 | **District visuals — axis investigated & judged feasible**: decompiled the full district-visual pipeline (`ConstructibleVisualAffinity` → `PresentationDistrict.UpdateLevelBuild` → `PresentationLevelBuildComponent.SetChannel` → `FxEvolverMaterialDrawer.mesh` (static `FxMesh` GUID) → the same `FxComponentMeshContentManager` the unit path uses). A district's visual is a named slot (the district-side `pawnDescription`) resolving to a single **static** mesh — simpler than a unit (no skeleton/clip). Clean Harmony seam exists (analogue of `UniRepointHook`), scoped per-district so the shared affinity is untouched. First experiment started: repoint ENC Stone Quarry at a custom quarry model. Spec: [District-Visuals.md](District-Visuals.md). |
| 07-17 | **PROJECTILE axis — PARTIAL (fourth injection axis)**: a custom model as a unit's fired munition — the Era-6 Anti Tank FPV throws a kamikaze drone. A `ProjectileAsset` has no mesh; the flying mesh is its `trail` → `FxEvolverMaterialDrawer.mesh` (a swappable `FxMesh` GUID the drawer auto-loads — no runtime registration). Editor: **Tools ▸ ENC ▸ Projectile Lab** (`ProjectileBaker.cs`) — Dump prints a **VERDICT** (usable donor = a mesh drawer with a **non-null mesh**; sprite drawers render our mesh **invisible**), then Bake = static bake → bone-free FxMesh → `CopySerialized`-clone the donor drawer with our mesh + clone the ProjectileAsset. Wired via the unit's `Projectile` field (data; plugin fallback `[Projectiles] ProjectileOverrides` / `Hk_ProjectileOverride`, off). Findings: **only thrown-solid projectiles are meshes** (all modern/siege/naval ones are sprites), and **all mesh donors share one brown atlas** — no cheap recolor (tint is ignored for textured meshes; the only fix is a custom FX atlas, shelved). Split-donor: mesh trail (ThrownSpear, stable) + **impact donor** (Mortar → real explosion + audio). Orientation: the drawer **welds mesh +Z to velocity** → `ImportAngles (0,−90,−90)`, avoid the X=90 gimbal pole. `WriteAssetKeepingGuid` keeps the ProjectileAsset's GUID across re-bakes (else the unit's field blanks silently → fires nothing). Shipped brown + legibility-limited (a simpler/chunkier model would silhouette better miniaturized). Full recipe: [Projectiles.md](Projectiles.md). |
| 07-18 | **PROJECTILE axis — count mechanic decompiled + single-pawn fix (now WORKING, one clean drone)**: the "wall of drones" was the game's normal multi-fire made *visible* by a slow big mesh. Fully traced: **one projectile per firing pawn** (gated by `pawnDef.Projectile != null`), and **waves = `ceil(defendersToKill / attackerPawnCount)`** (`UnitActionRangedFightSequence`) — a high-kill unit loops the throw until the kill count is met (3 soldiers + ~9 kills = 3 waves = the wall). Empirically ruled out the animator (only changes throw motion/sound), Same Row Attack (pawn-pairing), formation rows, Prepared Attack Loop. `Force Ranged Multi Kill` collapses to one wave BUT its instant-kill path skips `FireProjectile` (no drone) — so no data combo gives one-wave+visible-drone (would need a plugin cap, designed-not-built). **Fix that shipped: a SINGLE-PAWN (vehicle) base** → `ceil(1/1)=1` → one clean drone (Humvee proven). Also corrected the "cursed brown" claim: the skin **colour = which atlas region the model's UVs sample** (+ shifts with lit faces per orientation) — `drone_clean.glb` rolls grey/tan, so reroll by swapping the model. Orientation follows the **trajectory arc** (nose-down dive = correct kamikaze); final `ImportAngles (0,0,180)` for `drone_clean`. Projectile Lab gains: Dump **VERDICT** + donor auto-fill, an **impact donor** field (borrow an explosive sprite's boom onto a mesh donor), `WriteAssetKeepingGuid` (re-bakes keep the GUID so the unit ref survives), and `[SerializeField]` window persistence (Projectile Lab + Prop Lab survive domain reloads). Open: launch audio plays the unit's gun sound, not a drone whoosh. Docs: [Projectiles.md](Projectiles.md) updated. |
| 07-18 | **Animation Lab window (new) + Factory/Lab settings split**: animation authoring moved into a dedicated **Animation Lab** (`Tools ▸ ENC ▸ Animation Lab`, docks as a tab next to the Factory). Design settled after iteration: **Factory owns the MODEL** (identity, file, transform, size, shading; lists ALL entries), **Lab owns the ANIMATION** (clip/bones/unit-fix + fire-on-attack/deploy/recoil behaviors) — settings mutually exclusive, windows linked by jump buttons (`OpenFor` context handoff); Bake works identically from either (`ConfigFor → BuildAnimated → Upsert`, no forked logic). New **Save (no bake)** persists runtime behavior flags without re-running the pipeline. Hardening from incidents en route: dropdown **index-by-name** (a stale numeric index presented "Zeppelin" while the form held the howitzer), and **`animated` self-healed from the entry's config** (`LooksAnimated`) + a confirm dialog on rigged-file static bakes — a lost flag had silently re-baked the howitzer STATIC (tipped-over guns: the static path bakes the animated-path-ignored Rotation offset into the mesh). Regression-verified: TowedGunHowitzers re-baked through the new setup, deploy/fold/recoil in-game identical. Also: CLI **editor-assembly compile-check** rig established (FrameworkPathOverride + `Tools/NoAnalyzers.targets` + env `ReferencePath`); `rig_anim.py` comment for the pre-join junk cull. Docs: [Factory-Manual.md](Factory-Manual.md) §3 rewritten + new §15. |
| 07-18 | **First humanoid character + rotation-for-animated + enforced window ownership**: the Combine soldier (62-bone rig, `Idle1`) replaces the DroneSquadFPV Humvee — standing, right-sized, turning with movement, idling in-game. En route, three systemic fixes: (1) **Rotation is now REAL for animated models** — contract: `0,0,0` = the EXACT legacy pipeline (no rig manipulation; working models stay working — an unconditional-fold attempt flipped the previously-good howitzer upside-down in-game, because the fold is world-preserving for Unity's mesh import but NOT for Amplitude's skeleton bake); non-zero = rotate + `transform_apply` **into the data** (vertices + bone rests, identity nodes; object-level rotation alone is dropped downstream, and object-level anim fcurves are stripped so they can't re-assert orientation). Raw glTF rigs that round-trip lying down (soldier: a -90°X armature node) are now correctable — soldier needs `90,0,0`. ⚠ preview orientation for animated models is MEANINGLESS (fixed display flips; matched the soldier by luck, contradicted the howitzer) — probe one axis at a time, judge in-game only. (2) **Enforced field ownership across Factory/Animation Lab** — bake/save rebases on the freshest registry entry, each window contributes only its own fields (stale-copy bakes had clobbered Fix-100×, then rotation+size). (3) **BoneRotation layer discovery** — the game turns pawns through the procedural `PawnEntry.BoneRotation0-3` layer; blanket-clearing it (the old barrel-twist fix) froze the soldier's facing. Now cleared only for artillery-behavior models. OPEN (one subsystem): drone projectile visual lost on attack (pose hook stomps the throw anim that carries FireProjectile — fix: pass the game's pose through when it isn't idle/move), hood stretch after turning (junk BoneRotation slots with invalid bone index + 1500°+ angles on this donor — needs the layer's writer decompiled), temp `[Uni][facing]` diagnostic stays in. |
| 07-19 | **THE SOLDIER STANDS — raw-rig conversion completed (head mystery solved)**: the true root cause of the "torn/floating head" was neither the BoneRotation layer, nor scales, nor bone order, nor depth (each was a REAL defect, fixed en route, but masked the next): the auto-rig's clips **assemble the body from a scrambled rest pose via structural location keys** (frame-0 posed bones up to 91u from rest on a 73u rig; 129 location curves) — unplayable in Amplitude's rotation-only format by definition. Fix: **rest normalization + snapshot visual rebake** in `rig_anim.py` (snapshot all visual matrices per frame → apply armature modifier at frame 0 → Apply-Pose-As-Rest → re-bind → re-derive the entire clip as pure rotations against the new rest; in-bake verification residual 1.67e-4). Methodology wins: a **litmus rig** (12-deep chain of colored cubes through the full pipeline) exonerated the GPU runtime for clean rigs in one launch; raw-FBX byte inspectors (`fbx_binddump`/`fbx_lclscale`) found the exporter's ×100 root `Lcl Scaling`; full decompile of bake + runtime (ClipEntry.Reimport, Skeleton.Reimport, AnimationManager GetBoneTRS/ApplyPose/GetPoseTRS) established every invariant. Ship recipe for the soldier: rotation **360,0,0** (identity net, triggers the conversion path — gate refactor pending), size 2, Fix-100× OFF. Public state of the art remains "anything moving is not possible" — this pipeline now converts a raw Sketchfab humanoid to a working in-game unit. |
| 07-18 | **Evening hardening round (after the soldier landed)**: (1) **automatic geometry cache** — the animated Blender re-slim runs exactly when one of its inputs changed (rotation/tris/clip/bones/material/model), checkbox no longer gates it; relabelled **"Keep extracted texture (hand-edits)"** (its only animated-path effect). Killed the "rotation silently does nothing" trap that burned several ReconDrone bakes. (2) **preview renders one material per submesh** — a 75-slot mesh previously showed only submesh 0 (a lone propeller blade), read as a lost model. (3) **ReconDrone recipe recovered from the registry backup's GIT HISTORY** (the backup history = recipe archive) and settled at 5000 tris user-compared vs 12000; lesson: with reuse ticked, stored bake settings and actual assets can drift — the assets are the truth. (4) **head-tear triage on the soldier**: three BoneRotation-layer mechanisms tested via the `[Uni][facing]` diagnostic — full clear (freezes facing), angle wrapping (no effect), axis-selective zero of the donor's phantom **wheel-spin slots** (axis 0, invalid bone index; facing kept — kept in as hygiene). Head still tears **with the whole layer flat** ⇒ the layer is ruled OUT; suspect the baked skeleton/clip or Pose0 playback. Next session: decompile the pose/skinning consumer (with the drone-visual attack window + idle/run state machine — one subsystem). |
| 07-19 | **PHASE 2 SHIPPED + VERIFIED IN-GAME: state-driven idle/run/after — THE SOLDIER RUNS.** The full state machine: registry fields (`animStateDriven`, `animClipMove`/`animClipAfter`, `clipMove`/`clipAfter` GUIDs), a one-pass **multi-clip Blender bake** (all role clips snapshotted up front and rebaked against the PRIMARY clip's frame-0 rest — per-role rests would displace non-primary clips on the shared skeleton), per-role ClipCollections binding one skeleton, Animation Lab **State-driven** UI (Idle/Movement/After pickers), a ~20×/s movement poll (render-delta, settle-immune, per-pawn samples) and per-pawn clip selection. **Three hard-won runtime facts** (decompiled + experimentally proven): (1) `PawnManager.DoComputation` uploads the FULL pawn array to the GPU **every frame** — no id latching, per-frame `AnimationId` switching on Pose0 is safe and is the shipped mechanism; (2) the **secondary pose slots (Pose1/Pose2) misbehave** in the GPU pass — weight-switching them rendered the pawn invisible while moving (garbage id → a scale-0 entry collapses the mesh); avoid them; (3) **Rotation-format clip data cannot explode a mesh** (`GetPoseTRS` forces translation 0 / scale 1) — so *invisible* ⇒ wrong animation id, *frozen* ⇒ constant clip data: a diagnostic dichotomy. **The frozen-runner bug**: Blender's bone rename syncs fcurve paths ONLY for the assigned action — dormant role clips kept stale bone names, evaluated to nothing, and exported as 18-frame statues; caught by byte-level pose-data variance analysis (a healthy clip = varying+constant curve mix), pinned by elimination probes, fixed by explicit path patching, and guarded by a **tool-version cache-buster** (the slim cache reuses nothing older than rig_anim.py — the fix was silently bypassed once without it). |
| 07-19 | **ATTACK + COMBAT-IDLE states shipped + verified in-game — the 5-role state machine is complete** (attack > move > after > combat-idle > idle): the **Attack clip** plays when the unit actually fires — trigger = a Harmony postfix on `PawnRangedFightSequence.InitializeCommon` (ALL five constructors funnel through it: battle volleys, unit-target shots, district bombards; built presentation-side, so the shooter's Transform is read straight into the per-entry fire windows — no sim-thread GUID queue like the artillery hook). **`attackRepeats`** (runtime-only Lab slider): the window spans N × clip duration and pose Time is fed UNCLAMPED so the sampler's Repeat(Time,1) replays the clip back-to-back — the soldier's genuinely-0.17s `shootAR2s` pop × 18 ≈ 3 s of sustained fire (user-verified). The **Combat-idle clip** replaces Idle while the army is in a battle (`PresentationArmy.IsLockedByBattle`); the single-frame `CombatIdle1` stance bakes fine — rig_anim now pads 1-frame clips to 2 identical frames (Unity's importer can drop a zero-length animation whole) and Amplitude's FrameCount-1 encoding pins the sampler to frame 0 (a held pose). **Two field bugs, both read off the BepInEx log**: (1) `Hk_PawnRangedFight` was missing from Plugin.cs's EXPLICIT hook list — per-hook isolated registration means an unlisted hook fails 100% silently (no TargetMethod log at all); (2) **a battle spawns a SECOND PresentationUnit per combatant on its combat tile** (`PresentationBattleReportController.Battles → AllUnits`) while the army walk's sample sits at the STACK position (27.7u off, outside the 4u radius → "NO sample match": no stance, no movement state in battle) — the state poll now walks BOTH collections, key-salted (a shared movement key would ping-pong between the two positions = permanently "moving"; battle samples always combat=true). Process lesson: the CLI editor compile-check must run `-t:Rebuild` (incremental ran as a no-op and waved a real CS0103 through to Unity). |
| 07-19 | **HAND PROPS on custom skeletons shipped + verified — the soldier carries a textured M60** (grip correct through idle/run/stance/fire). The donor (an APC) has no weapon slots and `GetSlotIndex` −1 silently drops attachments, so `InjectHandProp` **constructs the FragmentEntry itself** at repoint: Prop-Lab MeshCollection (registered-lookup → catalog → bundle-name fallback), borrowed weapon output layer, boneName by substring against our renamed `b###_` bones. **Three decompiled+field-verified engine discoveries:** (1) the GPU pawn descriptor snapshots fragments at registration — and the game's own full rebuild is UNSAFE mid-load (skips not-loaded definitions WITHOUT reserving slots; in the field this scattered the recon drones and the howitzer and gave it soldier-motion) → replaced with a **surgical patch** of only our definition (fragments copied to the buffer tail, `descriptor[defId]` repointed); (2) **weapon materials are streamed 64×64 `_Proxy` placeholders** that Amplitude resets — a one-shot paint flip-flopped between sessions → the prop's own `<name>_Atlas` is painted on a **private layer clone** (unit-retexture isolation) and **repainted per tick** (ReferenceEquals fast-path); (3) **baked FxMesh import angles don't survive the mod bundle** — in-game the class default `(-90,0,0)` silently tipped every prop vs. the preview → the plugin **always stamps** the angles pre-encoding (registry override `handPropAngles`, else zero), so in-game equals the baked vertices (orientation authored via Rotation offset; the Prop Lab's import-angles field removed as a trap). Tooling: Prop Lab gained **Edit existing / New / Remove per-prop recipes** (`enc_props.json`); Animation Lab gained the **Hand prop combobox** (auto-resolves the collection GUID). Also: **Universal Model Factory renamed to Model Factory** (menu, title, docs; pre-existing docked tabs retitled via OnEnable — Unity caches titleContent). Fragment limit noted: no scale channel in the GPU fragment record (runtime pawn scale moves the glue point but can't resize the mesh). |
| 07-19 | **Per-pack asset folders + full framework-identity migration — VERIFIED in-game**: (1) file-based assets resolve **pack-relative first** — subdirectory packs `haf_packs/<mymod>/pack.json` discovered (default modId = folder name; `sounds/`/`skins/` inside are the pack's asset roots), flat packs get a same-named sibling folder, legacy shared `enc_sounds`/`enc_skins` remain the fallback — a third-party pack ships as ONE self-contained directory and stops "feeling like an ENC extension". (2) Framework identity went fully neutral in one clean cut (user call: zero external installs = no compat period): assembly/DLL → **`HumankindAssetFramework.dll`** (old DLL deleted in the same deploy — both present would double-patch), BepInPlugin GUID → **`community.humankind.haf`** (cfg copied to the new name, settings carried), editor menu → **`Tools ▸ HAF`** (all authoring windows + Tests + Tech Tree + Database Browser consolidated under one root). Kept deliberately: csproj filename, C# namespace, and all `enc_*` PACK files (packs are branded; only the framework is neutral). **First-session in-game verification clean** — plugin loads under the new identity, settings intact, units/districts/audio normal. Closes the last three items of the 6-point external doc review (front-door page, four-axes README, umbrella name, pack resolution, per-pack assets, naming). |
| 07-19 | **HAF pack resolution ENFORCED (was reserved-and-logged)** — external doc review called the gap between the multi-mod ambition and behavior the framework's most important discrepancy; closed: `ResolvePacks` now rejects duplicate `modId`s (first file keeps the id), validates `dependsOn` (missing dependency skips the pack, iterated to a fixpoint), **topologically sorts** load order over `dependsOn` + `loadAfter` with a STABLE seed-order Kahn (no declared constraints ⇒ byte-identical to the old base-first + filename order — today's single-pack setup provably unaffected; cycles fall back to file order, loudly), and the merge honors **declared `overrides`** (`{modId, pawnDescription}` replaces the targeted entry in place, logged as an override; an undeclared clash stays first-loaded-wins, loud). `haf_load_report.txt` gains RESOLUTION / OVERRIDES APPLIED sections. A field-level `patches` concept (vs whole-entry `overrides`) is deliberately deferred until a real compatibility pack shapes it. Docs: Multi-Mod.md rewritten to the enforced semantics. |
| 07-19 | **Post-review hardening batch + full guard sweep GREEN**: (1) **Fold-gating decision implemented (split gating)** — the destructive rest-fold (rest rewrite + visual rebake) now runs on the CONVERSION path only (`_loc0 and convert_rig`); the location-strip stays on BOTH paths deliberately (every verified legacy bake went through it; un-stripping risked the drone's unscaled-translation wobble). "Legacy byte-identical" now precisely means *no rig manipulation*, and a legacy model with location keys + shape keys no longer aborts. (2) **`deploy_convert.py` recoil hardened for non-M114 rigs** — the tube's parent is sampled whatever its name (was a guaranteed KeyError); RecoilArm holds key an IDENTITY BASIS (true pass-through at any parent pose) with arc targets on a parent-aware baseline (a moving carriage no longer displaces the tube through the deploy); empty tube-match fails loudly; dead `key_bone` removed. Shipped `m114_deploy.glb` predates this and stays. (3) **Feature Test Tier-2 routes through `ConfigFor`** — the hand-built config had dropped `convertRig`/rotation, baking the soldier through the wrong pipeline. (4) **Tests submenu** — the six guard entries moved to `Tools ▸ ENC ▸ Tests ▸`. **Verification sweep after all of it: smoke 14/14** (howitzer fresh-baked `animated-legacy` through the newly gated pipeline — bake-level proof of the gating decision; in-game check on the next real howitzer re-bake remains), **Tier-2 4/4** (soldier now visibly on the conversion path: `RIGANIM conversion path: ON`), **ConvGate litmus + registry PASS**. (The "Can't import normals — mesh 'default'" warnings during Tier-2 are benign: the synthetic OBJ fixtures carry no normals and Unity recalculates.) |
| 07-19 | **LAW 5 + THE KICK — the fire animation lands (late-night arc)**: the sandbox howitzer's attack went through five hypotheses (aim layer — EXONERATED, the donor streams runaway 5000° angles but at the INVALID bone-index sentinel, diagnostic log kept in ClearAimLayer; RecoilArm rest — verified correct in the baked Skeleton asset; slot rebinding; strip list) before the Arc-R scaling experiment proved **Law 5: bone POSITIONS are pinned at bind, only ROTATIONS animate** — the far-pivot arc renders as a modest in-place tube PITCH, which is what the proven legacy "kickback" always was at map zoom. Shipped kick = slam-only recoil range + **palindrome Return slow** knob (user-designed: the slam played backward slowed, gliding home; the source's own post-slam frames are reload choreography, deliberately excluded). Explored & parked in history (e280e91): the PRISTINE pre-retarget fire-window snapshot that can play the source's full fire cycle (kick + barrel lowering + raise) — plus an unbuilt runtime ObjectSpace-nudge option for true whole-body lurch. Hardened along the way: **conversion failure detection** (Blender exits 0 on python crashes — the baker reused a stale converted GLB and recorded bad args as success; success now = the script's own final marker), reversed recoil ranges rejected loudly, the Lab preserves unsaved form edits across reloads (banner + explicit choice instead of silent discard), raw-source **Play clip** button with single-frame stepping, and the clip player's go-to-frame buttons. All on branch `bake-only-stance`. |
| 07-19 | **BAKE-ONLY STANCE ARCHITECTURE + THE GATE — the state-driven howitzer lands, in-game verified** (branch `bake-only-stance`): the sandbox migration's remaining failures fell to a **measurement protocol the user mandated** ("it's not good until it's byte-identical to the proven TowedGunHowitzers"): byte-diff of `_ClipsPoseData.bytes` (identical ~100 frames then divergent = a locatable leak, not a mystery) + headless Blender pose-sweep gates on the slim FBXs (PASS = 0.0000 across all 250 frames vs the proven bake, idle stance == deployed pose bone-for-bone) — the whole Blender stage now gates **without Unity or the game**. Three root causes found+fixed in `rig_anim.py`: (1) **role slicing leaked pose values** into channels the primary doesn't key (save/restore every pose bone); (2) **export-time pose was arbitrary** — it becomes the FBX default = the engine's reference pose (every export now pins the clip's first frame); (3) pacing knobs don't belong at runtime (user ruling) — **slice speed step** `clip[a..b/N]` = every Nth frame = N× faster, baked. Architecture: **Idle stance (override)** role (`animClipIdle`/`clipIdle` end-to-end) — a stance baked as the PRIMARY encodes ~identity vs its own reference and renders as REST ("forgot to deploy"); the primary stays the FULL reference clip; the runtime idle-hold/deploySpeed overloads were reverted (strictly additive plugin change, gated on `clipIdle` data). Also: the legacy "instant fold" was demystified — it was the *absence* of a fold animation (empty Pre-move = the same snap; `/12` = a fast fold, user's pick). **All four engine laws + the sandbox/gate method + a symptom index written up in the new [Animation-Pitfalls.md](Animation-Pitfalls.md).** |
| 07-19 | **DEPLOY CONVERSION AS RECIPE (user-designed) + the ROTATION-ONLY authoring law, field-proven on a sandbox unit**: the rigid-parts conversion (`deploy_convert.py`) stopped being a hand-run Blender command (whose args lived in shell history — the M114 leg re-key was exactly such a lost step) and became **registry data**: `deployConvert` + knobs (trim start/end, strip, barrel ready-frame, **legScale** with empty = source legs verbatim, barrel scale, recoil range/step/slide/arc) on the entry; `UniversalBaker.EnsureDeployConverted` runs Blender automatically into `FactorySource/<res>/deploy_converted.glb` (cached on an args+source+tool fingerprint; a knob change reconverts AND re-slims via the mtime chain), and the converter's 7c step cuts **ready-made role clips** (`deployed/folded/unfold/fold/recoil`) that the Lab's roles reference by name. Verified end-to-end on a **sandbox entry** (SiegeHowitzersCar donor): raw Sketchfab file → recipe → 5-state artillery in-game. **The law it proved**: the engine bake keeps rotation and DISCARDS translation — legs that spread by rotation+slide play pivoting about the wrong point in-game (swept inward) even though the full-fidelity preview is perfect; `legScale 1` re-keys them as pure rotation — the once-"voodoo" step is load-bearing, now a documented one-field knob (Animated-Models.md "rotation-only law"). Supporting fixes the same session: the **clip range picker** (▶) rebuilt on real-object rendering after two hand-rolled BakeMesh renderers each corrupted the view (un-mirrored legs, giant parts — the "crossed legs" that triggered the whole investigation were never in the data); picker inspection FBXs export the animation COMPLETE (its location-strip was the picker-side corruptor) with a source-keyed cache; the Lab **re-syncs from the registry on every domain reload** + explicit ↻ Reload (closing the stale-form clobber trap for good); Lab Model-file Browse button; importer-synthesized `Icosphere` junk confirmed handled by rig_anim's material-less-mesh drop. |
| 07-19 | **Two-round adversarial code review (both repos, 5 parallel reviewers per round) — all HIGHs fixed**: Round 1 (~40 raw findings) surfaced and fixed the same day: a `Substring(-1)` crash in the baker's reused-FBX fallback (stale pre-FactorySource path assumption); the Factory bake silently reverting Retexture/Sound-owned fields (ownership merge now covers all third-window fields); the convertRig `Migrate()` re-firing every Load (now one-shot, keyed on the file predating the flag); Unit Retexture's Remove deleting FULL model entries listed as "overrides" (now clears overrides + confirmation dialogs); plugin **session lifecycle** — `registered` latched per-process while AnimationLoad rebuilds per-session (new `RearmModelRegistration` on the AnimationLoad postfix, mirroring the props axis) + the sim-thread `entries` race (publish-once + snapshot reads) + temp facing log removed; `rig_anim.py` failure posture (single-user-ize before modifier apply; hard-fail once the rest pose is rewritten — no more silent exit-0 half-normalized rigs). Round 2 adversarially verified **all ten round-1 fixes correct**, then found + fixed: SoundWindow's pick-then-edit **entry hijack** (resourceName fallback retargeted another pawn's full entry; fresh entries also inherited its name so Upsert replaced it); a fix-regression where pawns spawning in the transient-registry-retry window latched `anyAnimated=false` for the session (success publish now invalidates); incomplete re-arm (isolation layers/adjusted atlas/audio-listener latch now reset per session); a main-thread **infinite loop on corrupt WAVs** (negative RIFF chunk size). Also: Factory preview editor now torn down at `beforeAssemblyReload` (the per-recompile "SerializedObject has been Disposed" console error — Unity logs it inside DestroyImmediate, uncatchable at the call site). Verified-clean under two rounds: GUID nibble-swap math, keep-GUID re-bake, registry corrupt-guard/atomic-write/backup, patch exception discipline, cross-thread sample locking, deploy ramp math. Deferred findings tracked in [Review-Backlog.md](Review-Backlog.md). |
| 07-18 | **Conversion gate refactor — explicit "Convert raw rig" flag (Rotation defused)**: the raw-rig conversion pipeline is now selected by a dedicated Animation Lab checkbox (registry `convertRig`) instead of `rotation != 0`. The old trigger made Rotation a hidden pipeline switch — editing it on a working legacy model (the howitzer) silently rerouted the bake into the conversion (location-strip + rest-normalize could break a deploy clip), and a no-net-rotation conversion needed the `360,0,0` identity trick (how the soldier shipped). Now: flag OFF = byte-identical legacy always, regardless of Rotation; flag ON = the full conversion (rotation applied within it; `rig_anim.py` argv[8], absent = old inference so old callers keep exact behavior). Wired end-to-end: ModelDef + load-time auto-migration (animated + rotation≠0 → flag on), BakeConfig/ConfigFor, Lab checkbox + both windows' ownership merges, slim-cache key, smoke-test path grouping (`animated-conv` now = flag), ConversionGateTest fixtures. Registry data cleaned: soldier = rotation `0,0,0` + `convertRig true` (same output — 360° ≡ identity). **Verified in-editor**: smoke test 14/14 (soldier fresh-baked `animated-conv` via the flag at rotation `0,0,0`; legacy drone + howitzer byte-identical with the flag off; Retex entry `SKIP`), ConvGate full-conversion PASS on the real rig. |
| 07-18 | **Animated position offset now pawn-frame (was world-axis)**: `ApplyPositionOffset` rotated the planar (x = sideways, y = fore/aft) registry offset by the pawn's `ObjectSpace.Rotation` before adding — previously it added fixed WORLD axes, so the nudge pointed a constant compass direction and visibly drifted around the model as the unit turned (static models were fine: their offset is baked into the mesh = model frame). Motivating case: pushing the TowedGunHowitzers gun forward so the crew pawns don't intersect it — the clearance now holds in every facing (verified in-game). `TryQuaternion` reads Unity or Amplitude-layout quaternions reflectively; falls back to world axes (logged) if unreadable. z (altitude) stays world-up. |
| 07-21 | **ParseGuidCsv sign bug fixed + props "catalog gap" was a misdiagnosis + boot-tick silenced** (all verified in-game): `ParseGuidCsv` included `'-'` in its split separators, silently stripping the sign off negative `a,b,c,d` GUID components — the sling prop's MeshCollection (negative `a`) was requested with a corrupted GUID every session. With the sign fix, **Amplitude's catalog resolves mod-bundle MeshCollections by GUID fine once the bundle is mounted** — the documented "type-specific catalog gap" ([Pawn-Props.md](Pawn-Props.md) trap 3) was our own corrupted input, and the by-name `GetAllLoadedAssetBundles` fallback never worked at all (Amplitude mounts community bundles through its own provider — dead code, removal candidate). Second fix: the props Update-tick safety net ran every frame **from engine boot**, guaranteed-missing before any bundle mounts — 64+ red `Requested asset is not found` lines per launch in the Amplitude diagnostics, noise that actively buried a real DB error during the 07-21 load-failure debugging. Now armed only by the first `AnimationLoad` postfix (the registration moment that works) and paced to ~1 attempt/s. Diagnostics verified clean (0 lines, was 64+); `Sling_Collection` registers first-try; M60 hand-prop pipeline unaffected. |

## Open findings — 2026-07-07 critical review

### Editor pipeline (UniversalBaker / ModelFactoryWindow / ModelRegistry)

#### E1 🔴 Bake uses trimmed fields, registry stores the untrimmed original — silent no-inject — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-07)
`ModelFactoryWindow.cs` `DoBake`: `cfg` got `cur.pawnDescription.Trim()` but `Upsert(cur)` persisted the
raw string. Paste a pawn description with a trailing space → bake succeeds, registry entry looks valid,
but the plugin's substring match (`name.IndexOf(pawnDescription)`) never fires. "Baked ✓", model never
appears, no error anywhere. (`hideMeshes` is safe — the plugin trims per-token; `pawnDescription` is not.)
> **Fixed:** `DoBake` now trims every text field on `cur` itself before building the bake config, so what's
> baked and what's registered are identical.

#### E2 🟡 Remove button deletes by the *edited* name and always reports success — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-12)
`ModelFactoryWindow.cs`: removal keyed on the live `cur.resourceName` text field, not the selected entry
(`existing[selected]`), and `Remove()`'s bool was discarded. Editing the name field then Remove deleted a
*different* model — or nothing — while the status still said "Removed".
> **Fixed:** keys on `existing[selected]` and branches the status on `Remove()`'s actual bool ("Removed '…'"
> vs "'…' was not in the registry — nothing removed").

#### E3 🟡 Static bake of a skinned-only model ships a 0-vertex (invisible) unit — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-12)
`UniversalBaker.cs` static combine iterates only `MeshFilter`; a rigged FBX that imports as pure
`SkinnedMeshRenderer`s yielded `cVerts.Count == 0`, yet the bake completed, the GUID check passed (the
asset exists — it's just empty), and a registry entry for an invisible unit was written. Only trace:
`verts=0` in a Debug.Log.
> **Fixed:** a `cVerts.Count == 0` guard after the combine returns `Fail(...)`, pointing to the Animated path
> (where skinned meshes belong). Verified it does NOT false-trigger on valid models: 12/12 bake smoke test.

#### E4 🟡 `RunBounded` isn't fully bounded: unbounded pipe-drain after `WaitForExit` — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-12)
If the child exited but a grandchild (Blender helper) inherited the stdout handle, `WaitForExit(timeout)`
returned true and the `ReadToEnd` tasks never saw EOF — `GetAwaiter().GetResult()` then hung the editor main
thread forever, the exact freeze the cap exists to prevent.
> **Fixed:** the drain is bounded too — `Task.WaitAll(new[]{outTask, errTask}, remaining)`; on timeout it takes
> whatever completed (`TaskStatus.RanToCompletion`), observes any late fault, logs a warning, and continues (the
> process already exited cleanly). Normal bakes drain in ms — unchanged (12/12 smoke test).

#### E5 🟡 Delete-first re-bake destroys the last-good assets with no rollback — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-12)
Static and animated paths delete `_Skeleton/_Atlas/_ModelMesh/_Mat/_Model.prefab` *before* the fallible
steps run. If the re-bake then failed, the registry still pointed at now-deleted assets: "re-bake failed,
old model still works" became "re-bake failed, old model destroyed". (Delete-first is the deliberate
stale-skeleton fix — the gap was only the missing rollback.)
> **Fixed:** `Build`/`BuildAnimated` now snapshot the existing outputs (each `.asset` + its `.meta`, so the
> GUIDs survive) to a temp dir **outside** the project before the bake, and on any failure (exception or
> `ok:false`) restore them — wiping any partial new outputs first. Fail-safe by construction: the success path
> is unchanged (backup → bake → discard) and restore runs **only** on an already-failed bake, so it can't harm a
> good bake. Backing up outside `Assets/` avoids a duplicate-GUID import.
> **Runtime-verified (2026-07-13):** a dedicated Bake Feature Test case now bakes a cube, captures the `_Skeleton`/
> `_Atlas` Unity GUIDs + mesh content, forces a failed re-bake of the same resource (missing model file), and asserts
> the assets return with their **original GUIDs and content** — closing the earlier "restore path never triggered"
> gap and catching a non-atomic/GUID-losing restore. Passed (`skelGuidKept=True, atlasGuidKept=True, verts 24→24`).

#### E6 🟢 Corrupt project backup + missing registry = permanent Save lockout — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-12)
`ModelRegistry.Load` parsed the backup restore inside the same `try` whose catch set `lastLoadCorrupt`
and named `RegistryPath` — a file that *doesn't exist* in this scenario — so Save refused forever with
instructions that couldn't be followed.
> **Fixed:** the backup parse is now in its own try/catch; a corrupt backup is treated as "no backup" (a
> warning that names the *backup* path, `lastLoadCorrupt` stays clear, Save is not locked — there's no live
> registry to protect, and the next Save rewrites the backup).

#### E7 🟢 Stale `_Preview.prefab` shadows a static re-bake in the window preview — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-13)
Bake animated → re-bake static: the static delete-first list omitted `<name>/<name>_Preview.prefab`, and
`LoadPreview` prefers the anim path whenever it exists — so the preview kept showing the old animated model
while the game got the new static one.
> **Fixed:** the static path's delete-first now also removes the stale animated-preview assets
> (`_Preview.prefab` / `_PreviewMesh.asset` / `_PreviewMat.mat`) from FactorySource, so `LoadPreview` falls
> through to the fresh `_Model.prefab`. (The reverse, static→animated, was already fine: the animated bake
> regenerates `_Preview`, which `LoadPreview` then correctly prefers.)

#### E8 🟢 Texture leak per multi-material bake — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-12)
The per-material albedos loaded for `PackTextures` (up-to-4096² RGBA32 each) were never `DestroyImmediate`d;
Unity objects don't GC, so an iterating modder stranded tens of MB per bake until the next domain reload.
> **Fixed:** both `PackTextures` sites (static `BuildInner` + animated `BuildMultiAtlasAndRemap`) now
> `DestroyImmediate` the source albedos right after packing (they're copied into the atlas; the animated path
> keeps using only the `orderedAlb` *keys* afterward, not the textures).

### Tools — Blender scripts + glbconv (key items verified on Blender 5.1.2)

#### T1 🔴 `prep_model.py` reduce hard-fails on instanced (multi-user mesh) models — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-07)
`modifier_apply` on linked-duplicate data raises `RuntimeError: Modifiers cannot be applied to multi-user
data` (reproduced on 5.1.2). glTF/FBX importers create linked duplicates whenever nodes share a mesh —
common in Sketchfab models (wheels, missiles, rotor blades). Any such model with Reduce on failed the whole
bake, and the surfaced error was the misleading "Blender prep produced no GLB (exit 0)".
> **Fixed:** each object gets `o.data = o.data.copy()` when its data is multi-user, before the decimate
> modifier is applied — also the *correct* semantics (applying through each user would re-decimate the
> shared datablock). Verified end-to-end: a GLB whose import produces two objects sharing one mesh
> (`users=2`) now reduces cleanly.

#### T2 🟡 Reduce ratio counts polygons, but COLLAPSE ratio operates on triangles — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-08)
A quad-heavy model under-reduced by up to 2×: 20k quads (40k tris) with target 24000 computed ratio 1.0 →
*no reduction at all* → 40k tris shipped into the ~25k-ceiling engine buffer this feature exists to protect.
GLB inputs were immune (glTF is triangle-only); OBJ/FBX/.blend sources were exposed. The post-reduce log
also under-reported (counted polys, not tris).
> **Fixed:** ratio and the before/after report now count real triangles (`len(p.vertices) - 2` per polygon,
> like `rig_anim.py`). Verified end-to-end: a 10,000-quad OBJ (20,000 real tris) with target 5000 now
> computes ratio 0.25 and lands at 4,999 output triangles (independently re-imported and counted); the old
> code would have produced ~10,000. Triangle inputs are byte-identical in behaviour (each tri counts 1).

#### T3 🟡 `rig_anim.py` albedo grab takes the *first* `TEX_IMAGE` node, not Base Color — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-12)
Node order is creation order; a PBR material with normal/roughness maps could hand the Factory a **normal
map as the atlas albedo** — purple/garbled skin, no error.
> **Fixed:** `base_color_image()` now traces the Principled BSDF's **Base Color** input upstream to the nearest
> image node (through a mix/gamma node if present); falls back to any TEX_IMAGE only when there's no Principled or
> the input is unlinked. Blender-syntax-checked.

#### T4 🟡 `rig_anim.py` `join()` keeps only the active object's modifiers — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-12)
Active was `meshes[0]` (scene order); if that was a bone-parented prop without an Armature modifier, the joined
mesh exported with **no skin binding** — the whole model rigid/frozen, all green logs.
> **Fixed two ways:** the join target is now chosen as a mesh that *has* an armature modifier (fallback `meshes[0]`),
> and — the real guarantee — after the join the code re-adds an armature modifier bound to `arm` if none survived.
> The joined mesh keeps every source mesh's vertex groups regardless, so re-binding fully restores skinning.

#### T5 🟡 glbconv: negative-scale (mirrored) nodes don't flip triangle winding — ✅ FIXED, source + exe (2026-07-12)
Mirroring half a symmetric vehicle via scale (−1,1,1) is routine; those halves came out inside-out — invisible
under backface culling, silently "fixed" by users reaching for Double-sided without knowing why.
> **Fixed:** `Program.cs.src` now emits the triangle as `(A,C,B)` when `node.WorldMatrix.GetDeterminant() < 0`, and
> `glbconv.exe` was **rebuilt** (pinned SharpGLTF.Core 1.0.6, untrimmed + single-file-compressed so it stays ~35 MB;
> trimming was rejected — it changed OBJ/MTL output on 4 of 11 models). The rebuild was verified **geometry-identical
> across all 11 registry models**; its only other effect is a SharpGLTF UV-decode change (raw tiled UVs → pre-folded),
> which the baker's per-vertex fold makes equivalent *except* at tile seams (**3 of 208,198** Cobra verts, 0.0014%).
> The prior exe is backed up + in git. Build recipe + reproducibility note now in `Tools/glbconv/BUILD.md` (previously
> there was **no** build documentation at all — that gap is closed). Recommend a one-time in-game Cobra glance.

#### T6 🟢 Silent-empty outcomes in the Blender scripts — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-13)
- `rig_anim.py`: a typo'd bone-prefix filter stripped **all** fcurves → a frozen 1-frame clip baked and shipped
  with exit 0. **Fixed:** hard-fails on `kept == 0`, listing the model's actual animated bones so the prefix can
  be corrected.
- `prep_model.py`: a strip-only config with an over-broad substring exported an **empty** GLB "successfully" (the
  no-meshes guard only ran when reduce was on). **Fixed:** a no-mesh guard now runs before *every* export, failing
  loudly with a pointer to the strip list. Both Blender-syntax-checked.

#### T7 🟢 Tool lows — reviewed 2026-07-13, consciously deferred
Each was re-examined and left as-is: fixing any needs a glbconv rebuild and/or *changes output* on current models
(regression risk), for negligible benefit — none is reachable or impactful in the current pipeline. Revisit only if
one actually bites.
- glbconv **normals not inverse-transpose under non-uniform scale** — would change shading output on any
  non-uniform-scaled source (rebuild + regression risk); unreported, and the runtime flattens PBR anyway.
- glbconv **legacy single-material dup-material-name overwrite** — effectively unreachable: multi-material models
  take the *grouped* path (already `mat{i}`-prefixed); a single-material model has one material.
- glbconv **TGA alpha-depth byte / ~2× peak memory / skinned double-transform** — Unity tolerates the TGA byte,
  memory is fine for these small models, and skinned models take the *animated* path, not the static one.
- `prep_model.py` **comma-in-object-name** — inherent to the CSV `stripParts` interface the baker relies on; rare,
  and it fails *visibly* (the part just isn't stripped), not silently.
- `blend_export.py` **basename texture recovery / `.png` guess** — only affects rare `.blend` inputs; minor.

**Verified clean** (checked and explicitly cleared): glbconv's `mat_none` handling, TriMat/outTri
bookkeeping, MatName collision-proofing (`mat{i}_` prefix), the UV V-flip (including repeat-wrapped UVs),
0-material/null-name paths, Sanitize's filename safety; `prep_model.py`'s victim-set materialization (no
iterate-while-removing) and case handling; Blender 5.x slotted-action fallback in `rig_anim.py`; window
probe caching, GLB chunk parsing, and log scanning; `Plugin.cs` wholesale; `Prober.cs` (diagnostics,
defensively guarded throughout).

## Architectural findings — 2026-07-12

Where 07-07 hunted line-bugs, this pass treats *system structure* as the risk. The framework has the signature
of software that grew one feature-flag at a time; at its current size that accretion — not any single bug — is
the dominant risk, especially given the goal of many more models and an eventual shippable package.

#### A1 🔴 `OnPawnAdded` was a ~190-line per-pawn-per-frame god-method — ✅ FIXED (2026-07-12, `9b956a7`)
The hottest hook (runs per pawn-add per frame once any animated/freeze model is registered) inlined five
behaviors — skeleton rescue, freeze, loop, fire-once, deploy + recoil overlay. Each feature bolted on another
branch, and the branches interact (`deployOnStop && fireOnAttack`). Untestable as a unit; the interactions
lived only in the author's head.
> **Fixed:** decomposed into a thin dispatcher + one named handler per concern — `TryReadLastPawn`,
> `ForceOurSkeleton`, `ApplyFreeze`, `ApplyAnimatedPose`, with the pose-time logic split into a strategy
> dispatch (`ComputePoseTime` → `DeployPoseTime`/`RecoilOverlay`, `FireOncePoseTime`, loop) and the tail steps
> (`ClearAimLayer`/`ApplyPositionOffset`/`ApplyScale`/`LogPoseHookOnce`). Strictly behavior-preserving: same
> reflection reads, write-backs, ordering, thresholds, and log-gate fields; the boxed `PawnEntry` is threaded
> through a small `PawnCtx` and shared by reference so every `SetMember` lands on the same box. **Adding a new
> model behavior is now a new method, not another branch on the hot path.** Verified in-game across all three
> behaviors (drones loop, howitzer deploy+recoil, zeppelins freeze), each with multiple instances, plus a
> 12/12 bake smoke test.

#### A2 🟡 `ModelEntry` is a ~35-field bag mixing four concerns
Registry data, runtime-resolved handles (`skeleton`, `animId`, `skeletonId`), per-instance concurrent state
(`fireGuidQueue`, `deployProgress`, `deploySamples`), and behavior config all live in one class — so every new
feature touches the parser, the POCO, and the (now-decomposed) hot loop in lockstep. Natural next split, pairing
with A3: a plain serialized config record vs. a runtime-state object.

#### A3 🟡 The cross-repo registry schema is defined in FOUR places — now guarded by a real check (2026-07-12)
`ModelDef` (editor writer, JsonUtility) · `ModelEntry` (runtime) · the Newtonsoft parse · the regex-fallback
parse — a new field is edited in all four. **Mitigated (Option A — verify, don't merge):** `check_schema_parity.sh`
was rewritten to make drift loud. It now asserts (1) the Newtonsoft and regex read paths read the **same** key set,
(2) every read key is a `ModelDef` field the baker writes (minus a runtime-only allowlist), and (3) each read cast's
type matches `ModelDef`'s declared type; bake-time-only fields are listed as INFO. Proven to fail on all three drift
types (dropped regex key, unwritten key, type mismatch). The duplication still **exists** — this monitors it rather
than removing it. The deeper Option B (auto-deserialize into one POCO, drop the manual mapping, retire the regex
fallback) was deliberately not taken, per the standing "keep the two sides separate, just verify compatible"
preference; revisit B only if the manual mapping starts costing more than the guard saves.

#### A4 ✅ RESOLVED (2026-07-12) — one dismissed after verification, one fixed
- `UniversalBaker.MeasureLongestAxis` (animated path) — **DISMISSED (not a bug).** It reads mesh-local
  `sharedMesh.bounds` without a per-node transform, *but* `rig_anim.py` **joins all meshes into one** before the
  animated path measures (there is only ever a single skinned mesh), and size is position-invariant. The asymmetry
  with the static combine — which reads many *un-joined* `MeshFilter`s and so genuinely needs `rootInv *
  localToWorldMatrix` — is therefore justified, not a defect. Deliberately **not** "defensively fixed": transforming
  the single mesh's bounds by a non-identity SMR transform could rescale every current animated model for zero gain.
- `BuildMultiAtlasAndRemap` submesh→atlas-rect name match — **FIXED.** The loose `Contains`-both-ways `SimplifyMat`
  match collided: material `Body` (simplified `body`) matched `Body_Trim` (`bodytrim`) via `"bodytrim".Contains("body")`,
  and if the longer name sorted first, `FindIndex` returned the wrong rect → wrong texture on that submesh. Now tries an
  **exact** simplified-name match first, then substring, then the submesh index. Behaviour is identical for
  non-colliding models (only the collision case changes). Affects only the animated multi-material path — the static
  path matches by exact material *reference*.

#### A5 🟢 Package-readiness (the stated goal) — not close yet
ENC branding hardcoded (`enc_models.json`, `ENC.*` EditorPrefs); Blender discovery Windows/Program-Files-only;
machine-specific paths (D: backup, `C:\GameData` junction); the ENCReload README sends a package consumer to a
*different* repo for all docs. None are bugs — just the gap between "works on my machine" and "shippable to
strangers." Overlaps the deferred list's ENC-branding, Blender-PATH-discovery, and Blender-free-static items.

## Still deferred (from earlier passes — unchanged)

- **#3 Blender discovery** is Program-Files-only and `BlenderAvailable()` never probes PATH — the biggest
  real gap for adopters (winget/Steam/portable/macOS/Linux installs refused up front).
- **#4 `registered` never reset across a session** — latent for a main-menu → different-game round-trip
  *if* the game rebuilds AnimationManager. (Distinct from the empty-latch bug fixed 07-07.) Cheap
  insurance: cache the animMgr instance, reset on change.
- **#5 `anyAnimated` can cache `false` permanently** if the pawn hook fires before registration.
- **#6 `TryLoadAsset` return-value trap** in the asset loaders (prefer `LoadAsset` explicitly).
- **#7 `canBake` doesn't check the model file exists.**
- **#8 rig-block GameObject leak** (no try/finally around the prefab build).
- *(external #4)* **`OnPawnAdded` perf**: once any animated model is registered, the full hook body runs
  for every pawn in the game; member caching makes it survivable, but cost scales with total unit
  activity. Gate on a skeleton-id HashSet if it ever bites.
- **ENC branding** hardcoded (`enc_models.json`, `ENC.*` EditorPrefs, fallback path) — package-readiness.
- **Blender-free static pipeline** (package-readiness, pairs with #3): Strip could move into `glbconv`
  (it already walks named GLB nodes — skip stripped nodes' triangles in C#), and Reduce could use an
  in-process C# quadric simplifier (UnityMeshSimplifier-class, MIT) on the imported mesh. That removes the
  Blender dependency for ALL static bakes *and* the process-startup + GLB round-trip cost (the bulk of a
  ~33s prep pass). Blender then remains only for `.blend` inputs and the animated pipeline, shrinking the
  audience exposed to Blender discovery (#3). Rationale documented in `Building.md`.
- Minors: bake temp files not cleaned; `libraryfolders.vdf` parsing only decodes `\\`; no hard guard at
  the ~25k shared-vertex ceiling; `RespawnDelayFrames` effective granularity is 5 frames (scan throttle).

## Recommended fix order

**Architectural (2026-07-12):** ~~**A1**~~ ✅ · ~~**A3**~~ ✅ · ~~**A4**~~ ✅ (SimplifyMat collision fixed; MeasureLongestAxis verified-and-dismissed). Next: **A2** (`ModelEntry` config/state split), when Option B is tackled.

1. ~~**E1**~~ ✅ done · ~~**T1**~~ ✅ done · ~~**T2**~~ ✅ done — tier 1 complete.
2. ~~**E2**~~ ✅ · ~~**E4**~~ ✅ done (Remove key + honest status; bounded pipe drain).
3. ~~**T3 / T4 / T5**~~ ✅ done — the silent-corruption class (wrong albedo, lost skinning, inside-out mirror halves).
4. ~~**E5**~~ ✅ · ~~**E3**~~ ✅ done · **T6** — honest failures for empty/destroyed outputs.
5. Deferred list + lows as the package push approaches (Blender PATH discovery first among them).
