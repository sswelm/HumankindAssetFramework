# Animation Pitfalls — a field guide to the woes

Every trap in this document was hit for real, cost hours, and is now either fixed in the tooling or has a
one-field recipe answer. Read this BEFORE debugging an animated model that "looks wrong": the odds are your
problem is on this page, and the odds are the first three explanations you'll think of are not the cause.
(Case study behind almost every entry: migrating the M114 howitzer from the legacy fire/deploy behaviors to the
state-driven machine, 2026-07-19 — a day in which the model file was accused of corruption, three preview
renderers were rewritten, and the actual causes turned out to be four engine constraints nobody had written down.)

## The four laws

These are engine-level facts. They are not bugs, they cannot be patched away, and every recipe must respect them.

### Law 1 — The clip bake is ROTATION-ONLY
The engine's baked clips keep per-bone **rotation** and **discard translation** (`GetPoseTRS` forces
translation 0, scale 1). Any part whose source motion *slides* plays pivoting about the wrong point in-game.
- **Symptom:** a part sweeps through/into the model in-game (the M114's trail legs crossed inward) while every
  preview — Blender, the ▶ picker — looks perfect. Previews play full curves; the game doesn't.
- **Answer:** re-express the motion as pure rotation. For deploy-converted models that's one recipe field
  (**Leg spread scale** re-keys `*leg*` parts; the hidden far-pivot **RecoilArm** does it for barrel slides).
  For other rigs: author the motion rotationally, or accept the drift.

### Law 2 — A stance baked as the PRIMARY clip renders as REST
The primary clip defines the skeleton's **reference pose**; clip data encodes *against* it. Bake a 1–2-frame
stance as the primary and it encodes ~identity — in-game the unit shows the **rest pose** (usually the travel
pose) no matter what the stance was.
- **Symptom:** idle shows the travel/fold pose ("it forgot to deploy") although the stance clip previews
  correctly everywhere else. The byte tell: the baked `*_ClipsPoseData.bytes` rows are near-constant identity.
- **Answer:** the primary (Idle/reference clip) must be the **FULL source motion**; the stance goes in
  **Idle stance (override)** — a role clip, encoding real deltas against the full clip's reference (e.g.
  `deploy[179..180]`). This is why the Lab has two idle fields.

### Law 3 — Pacing is BAKED, never a runtime knob
The runtime plays every clip at its authored length (24 fps). A 7.5 s authored fold outlasts a one-tile map
move — the unit spends the whole trip in the fold's first frames ("it forgets to fold").
- **Answer:** the slice **speed step**: `deploy[179..0/6]` = every 6th frame = 6× faster (≈1.25 s). The step
  always lands exactly on the end frame. `/180` on a 180-frame motion degenerates to a 2-frame near-snap; an
  **empty** Pre-movement clip is a true instant snap (which is all the legacy howitzer ever did — its
  "instant fold" was the *absence* of a fold animation).

### Law 4 — What a preview shows is NOT what the game plays
Three different things can lie to you independently:
- a **custom editor renderer** can corrupt the view itself (two hand-rolled BakeMesh draw paths each mangled
  the M114 — un-mirrored legs, then giant parts — while the data was provably fine; the ▶ picker now renders
  the real instance through Unity's own pipeline for exactly this reason);
- the **▶ picker is a raw player** — it deliberately shows the source's FULL curves (translations included),
  so on translation-driven parts it will look *better* than the game (Law 1);
- **in-game is the only truth** for the final bake — and even there, remember the unit may be standing on a
  slope, mid-state, or showing a donor-layer artifact.

## The method: sandbox + gate

What finally broke the debugging loop was not a cleverer theory — it was a **measurement protocol**:

1. **Sandbox on a donor unit.** Never iterate on a shipping entry. Clone the recipe onto a throwaway unit
   (the SiegeHowitzersCar donor) so every failed bake costs nothing and the working entry stays as reference.
2. **Gate against the proven bake.** When a "should-be-identical" bake misbehaves, don't stare at the screen —
   **diff the artifacts**:
   - `Assets/Resources/<name>_ClipsPoseData.bytes` — byte-compare against the proven model's file. Identical
     prefix + divergence at frame N is a *location*, not a mystery (a scene-state leak was found at frame ~103
     this way).
   - slim FBXs — sample both in headless Blender and diff evaluated bone poses per frame (the gate scripts:
     load both, `frame_set` sweep, compare world bone heads + local quats; PASS = 0.0000). The whole Blender
     stage can be gated **without ever opening Unity or the game**.
3. **Change ONE delta per bake.** The sandbox failures compounded exactly when several knobs moved at once
   (settings drift + stale caches + new file). The gate tells you which delta mattered.
4. **Bytes over eyes.** Every "the file is corrupt!" accusation this day was wrong; every byte/pose diff was
   right. Measure chirality, don't eyeball crossed legs; measure pose rows, don't squint at stances.

## Symptom index

| Symptom (in-game unless said otherwise) | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Part sweeps through the model; previews fine | Law 1 (translation stripped) | re-key as rotation (legScale / RecoilArm) |
| Idle shows travel pose; stance previews fine | Law 2 (stance-as-primary) | full clip as Idle/reference; stance in Idle override |
| "Forgets to fold" — travels deployed | Law 3 (fold outlasts the move) | speed step `/6`…, or empty Pre-move = instant snap |
| Fold/unfold plays but glacially | Law 3 | speed step |
| Unit invisible | wrong animation id (invisible ⇒ id, frozen ⇒ constant data — the diagnostic dichotomy) | check `[Uni] clip` log lines resolve |
| Unit frozen mid-pose | constant clip data (hollow bake) | byte-check PoseData; re-slim (cache busters below) |
| Whole unit tiny/huge/floating | FBX unit scale | **Fix 100× oversize** per model |
| Baked skin scrambled on one part (wheel) | multi-material albedos missing — the animated path now generates them (glbconv) but a failed extraction falls back to a single atlas, loudly | check `[glbconv]` Console errors, re-bake |
| Preview (custom window) shows mirrored/giant parts | Law 4 (renderer bug) | render real instances (`AddSingleGO`), never hand-rolled BakeMesh draws |
| Settings revert / edits ignored after compile | stale window form (survives domain reload) | the Lab re-syncs on reload + **↻ Reload** button; registry file is the truth |
| A knob change bakes identical output | stale slim cache — **edits made through the Lab re-slim automatically**; edits made directly to the registry file behind an open window do NOT (the cache compares form vs file) | ↻ Reload first, or delete `anim*/…_anim.fbx` |
| Crossed/wrong limbs in a stance ROLE clip (historical) | role slicing leaked pose values into channels the primary doesn't key | fixed: slicing saves/restores all pose bones (`rig_anim.py`) |
| Same bake differs run to run (historical) | export-time pose was whatever frame the tool last touched — it becomes the engine's reference | fixed: every export pins the scene to the clip's first frame |

## What the legacy howitzer really was (calibrate your expectations)

The "old functionality" everyone remembers was **one clip + two runtime tricks**: hold the full deploy clip at
normalized time 0.999 when idle (0.999, not 1.0 — `Repeat(1.0)` wraps to frame 0, the folded pose: the original
edge-overflow bug), and snap to frame 0 while moving. No stance clips, no fold animation, no state machine.
Recreating it state-driven therefore wasn't porting — it was building five clips through machinery the legacy
path never exercised, which is why "it worked before" was true and useless at the same time. The state-driven
equivalent that ends up matching it, entirely in data:

| Role | Clip | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Idle / reference | `deploy` (full) | Law 2 — defines the reference pose |
| Idle stance (override) | `deploy[179..180]` | the deployed hold, as a role |
| Movement | `deploy[0..0]` | travel stance |
| Pre-movement | `deploy[179..0/12]` (or empty) | fast fold (empty = legacy instant snap) |
| After-movement | `deploy[0..179/3]` | the unfold |
| Attack | `deploy[180..250]` | the source's own recoil kick |
