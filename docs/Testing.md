# Testing

The plugin has a focused unit-test suite (**44 tests as of 2026-08-02**) over the **pure registry/parse/era layer** —
the half of the runtime that touches no live-game reflection. It is a deliberate, bounded suite, not a coverage target:
it guards the functions where bugs have actually hidden, and stops there on purpose.

```
dotnet test Tests/HumankindAssetFramework.Tests.csproj -c Release
```

## What it covers

| Function | Lives in | What's asserted |
|---|---|---|
| `ParseModels` | `UniversalInjectPatch.cs` | JSON→`ModelEntry` field mapping; defaults (`animPhaseSpread` 0.5, `scale`/`brightness` 1); signed GUID components; **per-object isolation** (an omitted field doesn't shift onto another model); **robustness** — garbage/empty input → empty *without throwing*; the regex fallback recovery when `JObject.Parse` rejects the document (keys entry count on `Min(pawnDescription, skel, atlas)`) |
| `ResolvePacks` | `UniversalInjectPatch.cs` | duplicate-modId reject (first file kept); `dependsOn`/`loadAfter` ordering; missing-dep skip + **transitive strand** (fixpoint); cycle → file-order + note; soft `loadAfter` to an absent modId; **stable seed order** (the invariant that keeps today's single-pack setup byte-identical) |
| `LongestMatch` | `UniversalInjectPatch.cs` | most-specific substring wins (not first-in-order); single-match fallback; no-match → null |
| `RegexStrArray` | `UniversalInjectPatch.cs` | wrapper string-array extraction; empty-item filtering; missing field → empty |
| `CoreDesc` | `UniversalInject.Combat.cs` | trailing `_NN` variant-suffix strip |
| `GuidToLong` | `UniversalInject.Combat.cs` | null / non-numeric → 0; numeric string parses |
| `EraFromName` | `UniversalInject.ScaleEra.cs` | extract `EraN` (case-insensitive, multi-digit); none/null → −1 |
| `EraAnchorFor` | `UniversalInject.ScaleEra.cs` | the Global Era Lab anchor rule — **a unit stays at 1.0 unless an authored grid cell says otherwise** (own-age-or-earlier → 1.0; later-but-unauthored → 1.0; non-positive eras clamp cleanly) |

These map directly to the registry bugs this codebase has actually hit — the `ParseGuidCsv` sign bug, `LongestMatch`
ambiguity, "wrapper-parse drops overrides", the substring pawn-match — so the suite is a **regression net, not
coverage theatre**.

## How it's wired

- **Framework:** xUnit, `net471` (matches the plugin), one test project `Tests/HumankindAssetFramework.Tests.csproj`.
- **Access:** the tested helpers are `internal`, exposed to the test assembly via `[InternalsVisibleTo]`
  (`Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`). A few were bumped `private→internal` purely for this; none were made `public`.
- **`Plugin.Log`:** null outside the game, so each test class's ctor sets `Plugin.Log = new ManualLogSource("test")`
  (a listener-less source → every `LogXxx` is a safe no-op).
- **Dependencies:** needs the same gitignored `References\` DLLs as the plugin build; the test project mirrors them
  into its own bin so the plugin assembly's deps resolve at runtime. `Tests\**` is excluded from the plugin's compile
  globs so the xUnit files never leak into the plugin build.

## What is deliberately NOT unit-tested — and why

This boundary is intentional. Adding tests past it would be green ceremony that guards nothing real.

- **The runtime/integration seam** — inject, pose, muzzle, audio, districts, formations. These reflect into Amplitude
  types that only exist inside the running game process; they can't be loaded in a test host. Their correctness comes
  from **fail-soft resilience** (per-entry try/catch, null-guards), the **rebuild → relaunch → verify-log** discipline,
  and the editor-side bake smoke/feature tests — and, eventually, the **in-game smoke seam (maintainability plan
  Phase 5)**, which is the *right* instrument for this half and is parked until the package push.
- **`ParseGuidCsv`, `MakeGuid`, `EmitterName`** — build/consume Amplitude types via reflection, absent in the test host.
- **`FindEntryForUnitDefinition`** — delegates to the already-tested `LongestMatch` + `CoreDesc`; testing it would mean
  exposing the `entries` global as a test seam for ~zero new coverage.
- **Trivia** (`StrList`, `SanitizeFile`, one-line accessors) — too trivial to regress meaningfully.

## Adding a test

1. If the target is `private`, bump it to `internal` (never `public` just for tests) — `[InternalsVisibleTo]` handles
   the rest.
2. Only test **pure** logic (string/JSON/data in → data out). If it reflects into Amplitude/Unity, it belongs to the
   Phase-5 in-game seam, not here.
3. Set `Plugin.Log` in the fixture if the code under test logs.
4. Prefer tests that pin a **real invariant or a historic bug**, not line coverage.
